# 0.19.0

-   this is an attempts at making the module compatible with all the system's `5.3.0` changes

# 0.18.1

-   fixed attacks without event error

# 0.18.0

-   the module doesn't use `RollOption` anymore to modify cover & visibility, it now has its own custom `Rule Element` instead
-   you should now be able to use most of the predicates with the `Rule Element` to fine tune the conditions for it to apply
-   added `CloudKill` to the list of automated mist templates (it will have a slight green-ish color)
-   added support for the `See Invisibility` system sense
-   flat checks generated by blindroll attacks will now also be rolled blind
-   fixed token actors without sense but with token vision breaking the detection

# 0.17.0

-   complete rework of the detection, the module now respects the vision source (i.e. no more tokens undetected for all owned/observed tokens for players), the detection now also completely uses the conditionals and the rollOptions
-   added support for the `invisible` condition, it will automatically apply the `hidden` state to the token if the current one isn't at least that high
-   added `visibility:seeinvis:all` rollOption which will reduce the `hidden` or `undetected` state of a token to `concealed` if they are `invisible`
-   added `Stinking Cloud` to the list of automated mist templates
-   the `prone-cover` option is now always shown in the perception and validation menus
-   rollOption will now properly work when the attacker <-> target roles are reversed
-   fixed greater darkvision not working
-   fixed issue with the `reduce` rollOption when using the default values `none` and `observed`

# 0.16.0

-   added support for mist templates, it works the same way as darkness templates (exposed its functions to the API)
-   tokens selected (and highlighted) by the seek action templates will now use the position of the token that is seeking as collision origin instead of the template's origin itself, preventing tokens behind corners to be selected by the template
-   removed GM auto opening of validation menus
-   fixed darkvision removing non light/darkness related `hidden` (#12)

# 0.15.0

-   added support for darkness templates, some spells are automatically handled, the module will update the detection as well as use them to modify the visibility on attacks
-   added button to the seek action chat card to delete the associated template
-   exposed even more functions to the API including `createSeekTemplate` and `createDarknessTemplate`
-   the `seek` action now uses a `sight` template which means that walls that don't block sight will not block the seek template
-   fine tuned how the `seek` action works when no template is used
-   the warning message about `PF2e Rules-Based NPC Vision` will now indicate which module it refers to instead of the cryptic `this`

# 0.14.0

-   `darkvision` is no longer taken into account for conditional `hidden` in PoV detection
-   fixed flat-check degree of success not doing anything
-   fixed numerical rollOptions values not being cast as numbers

# 0.13.0

-   only account for `darkvision` and `low-light vision` for the visibility provided by the light exposure part of the module
-   removed `Automate Light Exposure` setting, this cannot be optional if we want `darkvision` and `low-light vision` to ever be taken into account
-   reverted not showing conditional icons when the actor had `low-light vision` and `darkvision`

# 0.12.0

-   `concealed` and `hidden` conditional icons will no longer show up if the hovered token actor has respectively `low-light vision` and `darkvision`
-   fixed error with messages that were generated without the module active of with a previous version of the module
-   fixed PoV vision showing tokens as hidden when selected token has darkvision

# 0.11.2

-   fixed flat-check not working with system version `5.2.3`
-   fixed automated creature cover testing against target token itself

# 0.11.1

-   fixed flat-footed being applied when hidden attacker was targeting a token with darkvision
-   fixed issue with extra large creature hidden in scene messing up with the automated creature cover test always returning standard cover

# 0.11.0

-   added NPC `Rule Based Vision` support, you need to enable the vision on the NPC tokens for it to take action
-   added `Force NPC Vision` setting which will force the `Vision Enabled` option on newly created NPC tokens, this can be set on a per-scene basis
-   added a warning if the `PF2e Rules-Based NPC Vision` module is active, both modules will conflict with each other
-   moved custom context flags into a single namespace
-   fixed issue with the rollOption `set` when using `none` and `observed`

# 0.10.0

-   added `cover|visibility:set:x` rollOption to force a cover|visibility state equal to `x`, here `x` cannot be `all` but accept `none` for cover and `observed` for visibitlity
-   added a button in attack chat cards which allows the GM to un-hide the token that initiated the attack
-   added support for NPC senses using the senses shown in `Special Senses` field ; also, and even though the system doesn't support it and gives a warning, NPCs can use the `Sense` Rule Element to add temporary vision senses (e.g. using a darkvision spell effect or similar)
-   messages are now parsed during the `ready` hook on first load and after a refresh of the browser tab
-   the module will no longer roll a flat-check for hidden targets when the attacker has darkvision
-   changed the rollOption `visibility:noflat:x` to be `visibility:noff:x`, the former could be confused with "no flat-check" instead of "no flat-footed" (i confused myself with it...)

# 0.9.0

-   did a complete refactor of the rollOptions, you can find a summary of how they work here: https://github.com/reonZ/pf2e-perception#roll-options

# 0.8.0

-   added support for custom rollOptions, those can be added via the system `RollOption` or directly provided in the attack options arguments, here is an example on how to implement the `Blind-Fight` feat, just add those 3 REs in the feat itself:
-   removed automated support for the `Blind-Fight` feat
-   you can now manually override a cover in the modifiers window (the one you need to hold shift to show or not show during a check roll)

# 0.7.2

-   fixed an issue brought by `11.306`

# 0.7.1

-   fixed issue with automated light exposure always considering tokens `hidden` in scenes that had vision/exposure disabled or not in the dark

# 0.7.0

-   replaced `Automate Concealment` setting with `Automate Light Exposure`
-   the system now check if a token is in bright light, dim light or darkness when it comes to automatically checking its visibility state
-   added `Perception Menu Permission` setting which allow you to select which minimum permission a user must have to be able to interact with the perception menu (keep in mind that the menu is a major spoiler if given access to players)
-   added `Conditional Icons` settings menu where you can set custom path to icon images that will be displayed on token hover
-   added `Flat Check` setting allowing you to disabled module flat checks, roll flat checks before attacks or canceling the attacks entirely on failure
-   the `Hide` and `Seek` actions now properly use the degree of success provided by natural 20/1
-   you can now also validate the `Seek` action even without having used a template (you can also manually target)
-   automated creature cover will no longer care for the type of attack (reach, ranged, etc.), it will still require a minimum of 1 square of distance between attacker and target
-   when a player hover over a token, they will not be shown visibility tokens above `concealed` if the other token isn't owned by a player, this prevent players from knowing if they are indeed hidden/undetected from another token
-   fixed validation buttons not showing up on chat message roll cards when using `Dorako UI` module
-   fixed issue with orphan tokens
-   fixed target-less point-out error
-   fixed greater cover giving the wrong bonus value

# 0.6.1

-   fixed a bug during automated concealment check preventing attacks

# 0.6.0

-   non-listed first release
