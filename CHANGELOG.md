# 0.7.0

-   replaced `Automate Concealment` setting with `Automate Light Exposure`
-   the system now check if a token is in bright light, dim light or darkness when it comes to automatically checking its vibility state
-   added `Perception Menu Permission` setting which allow you to select which minimum permission a user must have to be able to interract with the perception menu (keep in mind that the menu is a major spoiler if given access to players)
-   added `Conditional Icons` settings menu where you can set custom path to icon images that will be displayed on token hover
-   added `Flat Check` setting allowing you to disabled module flat checks, roll flat checks before attacks or canceling the attacks entirely on failure
-   the `Hide` and `Seek` actions now properly use the degree of success provided by natural 20/1
-   you can now also validate the `Seek` action even without having used a template (you can also manually target)
-   automated creature cover will no longer care for the type of attack (reach, ranged, etc.), it will still require a minimum of 1 square of distance between attacker and target
-   when a player hover over a token, they will not be shown visibility tokens above `concealed` if the other token isn't owned by a player, this prevent players from knowing if they are indeed hidden/undetected from another token
-   fixed validation buttons not showing up on chat message roll cards when using `Dorako UI` module
-   fixed issue with orphan tokens
-   fixed target-less point-out error
-   fixed greater cover giving the wrong bonus value
